# Date and Time

These functions can be used to get the amount of time elapsed since the start of the game. They are non-deterministic and should not be used outside of debugging.

- [`current_time()`*](https://manual.yoyogames.com/GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Maths_And_Numbers/Date_And_Time/current_time.htm)
- [`get_timer()`](https://manual.yoyogames.com/GameMaker_Language/GML_Reference/Maths_And_Numbers/Date_And_Time/get_timer.htm)

*Since TXR is unable to get read-only variables, `current_time()` is a function and should be treated as such.
