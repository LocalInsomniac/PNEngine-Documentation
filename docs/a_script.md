# Script

Scripts are text files (.txr) containing snippets of code that are compiled at runtime and used for level scripting through events.
A script can be run from an event using an event handler, which can be triggered at the start of a level, or from event triggers.
Scripts can also have arguments passed to them when executed, and can be paused for multiple ticks.

PN Engine uses a fork of Tiny Expression Runtime to allow level scripting. The scripting language is very similar to that of Game Maker Language.
